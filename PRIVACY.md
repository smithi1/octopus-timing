### Privacy Policy
Ian Smith provides the Agile Octopus Timing Alexa Skill (“the Skill”), as a free service that is made available without obligation. It is made available in the hope that it will enable greener and more cost-effective electricity usage for customers of the [Agile Octopus][1] tariff provided by [Octopus Energy][2].

The first time you invoke the Skill, it will ask you to visit the Alexa app to authorise it to access your country and postcode information.

Subsequently, each time you invoke the Skill, it will request your postcode from Amazon. It makes use of the first three or four characters (the “postcode sector”) to look up your electricity region. The Skill does not store your postcode and instead requests it from Amazon on each invocation. You may rescind this authorisation at any time in the Alexa app. If you do so, the Skill will seek permission from you again the next time you use it.

The Skill communicates with Octopus Energy via the publicly available [Octopus Energy API][3], which is a programming interface that allows the Skill to retrieve information from Octopus Energy. At this time, Octopus Energy does not require any identifying account information to access the data used by this Skill. Therefore, no information specific to any account that you may hold with Octopus Energy is currently required or used.

The Skill creates log entries, stored on Amazon’s servers, that are designed to help highlight and then subsequently debug problems that may occur with the Skill. If there is a problem with postcode lookup when you use the Skill, your postcode may appear in a log file. These log entries cannot be connected back to you or your Alexa device. The logs are configured to be retained for 90 days and will then be automatically deleted by Amazon.
